# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a duplicate component for player stats matchup analysis and update the import in PlayerAggregateStatsPage.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new file MatchupAnalysisDropdownPlayerStats.tsx as an exact copy of MatchupAnalysisDropdown.tsx
- Update the import statement in PlayerAggregateStatsPage.tsx to use the new component file

**User-visible outcome:** No visible changes to the user interface; this is a refactoring to separate the player stats dropdown component from the original matchup analysis dropdown.
