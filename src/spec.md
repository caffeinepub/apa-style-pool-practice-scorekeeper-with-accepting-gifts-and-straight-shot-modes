# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update matchup analysis display and improve PPI calculation accuracy using best 10 of last 20 official matches logic.

**Planned changes:**
- Include both practice and official APA games in matchup analysis on View Detailed Player Stats screen with visual labels/badges to differentiate them
- Update average PPI and average aPPI calculations on Official APA tab to use the 10 highest-scoring matches from the most recent 20 official matches
- Apply best 10 of last 20 calculation logic to all skill level predictions on View Detailed Player Stats screen

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see more comprehensive matchup history including practice games with clear visual distinction, and skill level calculations will reflect performance based on their best 10 recent official matches rather than simply the last 10.
