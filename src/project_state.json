  "summary": "APA pool practice scorekeeper app focused on APA 9-ball (not 8-ball), using The Equalizer® point-based scoring with per-rack ball/dead-ball tracking, defensive shots, innings, PPI, and end-of-match team match-point conversion; plus additional practice modes: Accepting Gifts and Straight Shot.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Straight Shot is a drill scored by total strokes/shots (goal: 20 or under) with mode-specific stats including scratches (+2) and a moving average across sessions; ensure UI copy avoids calling it 'straight pool'.",
    "Need explicit rule decision for scratch-on-break when break shot itself doesn’t count (user spec: possibly counts as 1).",
    "APA mode must be APA 9-ball (Equalizer points), not an 8-ball-style race; remove/avoid any 'race to X' concepts in UI and logic.",
    "APA 9-ball session tracking should support rack-by-rack 10-point accounting: player A points + player B points + dead balls = 10 each rack; include 9-ball worth 2, dead balls worth 0, and support defensive shots + innings for correct PPI.",
    "APA 9-ball rules constraints to encode: no push-outs (standard handicapped APA 9-ball), 9-on-the-snap ends rack with 2 points, three consecutive fouls within a rack loses the rack and remaining balls become dead.",
    "APA 9-ball active scoring UI should mirror official APA scorekeeper flow: per-rack display of balls 1–9, tap-to-select pocketed balls for the current inning, Turn Over control to switch players, innings auto-increment logic, and in-flow toggles/controls to mark dead balls and defensive shots.",
    "APA 9-ball practice rule: when the 9-ball is pocketed early (ends the rack), all remaining balls in that rack should be marked dead (0 points) to preserve 10-point rack accounting.",
    "Accepting Gifts progression: user wants minimum object balls = 2 (not 1) and the starting ball count for a new session should default to the last saved/current count from the prior session; also provide a manual reset/override to any allowed count (e.g., jump to 7)."
