  "summary": "APA pool practice scorekeeper app (APA 9-ball Equalizer) with per-rack ball/dead-ball tracking, defensive shots, innings, PPI, match-point conversion, and additional practice modes (Accepting Gifts, Straight Shot); plus a discrete 4th mode to log real/official APA matches and chart both actual PPI and adjusted PPI (each with best-10-of-last-20 rolling line). Invite-only access control/login approval is deprioritized/optionally disabled for now to ship a working version.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Straight Shot is a drill scored by total strokes/shots (goal: 20 or under) with mode-specific stats including scratches (+2) and a moving average across sessions; ensure UI copy avoids calling it 'straight pool'.",
    "APA mode must be APA 9-ball (Equalizer points), not an 8-ball-style race; remove/avoid any 'race to X' concepts in UI and logic.",
    "APA 9-ball session tracking should support rack-by-rack 10-point accounting: player A points + player B points + dead balls = 10 each rack; include 9-ball worth 2, dead balls worth 0, and support defensive shots + innings for correct PPI.",
    "APA 9-ball rules constraints to encode: no push-outs (standard handicapped APA 9-ball), 9-on-the-snap ends rack with 2 points, three consecutive fouls within a rack loses the rack and remaining balls become dead.",
    "APA 9-ball active scoring UI should mirror official APA scorekeeper flow: per-rack display of balls 1–9, tap-to-select pocketed balls for the current inning, Turn Over control to switch players, innings auto-increment logic, and in-flow toggles/controls to mark dead balls and defensive shots.",
    "APA 9-ball practice rule: when the 9-ball is pocketed early (ends the rack), all remaining balls in that rack should be marked dead (0 points) to preserve 10-point rack accounting.",
    "Accepting Gifts progression: user wants minimum object balls = 2 (not 1) and the starting ball count for a new session should default to the last saved/current count from the prior session; also provide a manual reset/override to any allowed count (e.g., jump to 7).",
    "Introduce a per-device/account \"Primary Player\" concept so the app recognizes the main user across matches while still allowing ad-hoc opponent names.",
    "Results UX: keep individual match view; add navigation/button to a per-player Aggregate Stats view with graphs computed from that player name across saved matches.",
    "Privacy/team rollout: implement optional invite-only access control for Internet Identity by maintaining an allowlist of approved principals plus a pending-requests list for owner approval (Approve/Reject + 'Reject All Pending'); non-approved users are blocked; plan for a future toggle to disable this for public release."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "User reports login/session state was lost (had to redo login). Investigate persistence/auth regression causing logout or lost saved credentials.",
    "Bug: entering the Primary Player name into Player 2 does not update the skill level on the match page; also possible to start a match with the Primary Player name in both Player 1 and Player 2 (should be blocked).",
    "App can get stuck on the “Checking access…” loading screen during access-control checks; needs a fail-open/disable option or clear error/timeout so the app remains usable.",
    "Regression: the score \"out of\" functionality (displaying each player’s score relative to the computed points-to-win target) was removed; it must be restored (e.g., \"Your Score (out of X)\" / \"Their Score (out of Y)\" based on selected skill levels).",
    "Official/Real APA Match Log: Save is blocked with validation message \"Unable to determine match winner\" (winner/outcome computation/validation logic may be incorrectly rejecting valid entries or requiring fields unexpectedly).",
    "Official/Real APA Match Log: Save action fails with \"Failed to save match\" when saving from Match History / match log flow (save payload or backend validation mismatch/regression).",
    "Regression/bug: Match History sort control (toggle Newest/Oldest by match date) is missing/not shown even when history list contains matches (user reports 3 matches visible but no sort option).",
    "APA Practice: match does not stop immediately when a player reaches their points-to-win target; scoring can continue into subsequent rack(s), causing final scores to exceed the target (e.g., 36).",
    "APA Practice: innings auto-increment logic is incorrect—innings only increment after the 2nd player’s turn/turnover, resulting in too-few innings counted for the match.",
    "Official/Real APA Match Log: Save gets stuck on \"Connecting\" after entering inputs (cannot complete save). Likely save-mutation/network/actor readiness state deadlock."
