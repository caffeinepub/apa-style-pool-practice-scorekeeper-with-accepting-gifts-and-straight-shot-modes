      "featureTitle": "Fix the Official APA Performance Charts so they render reliably (not blank) by removing the current merged `dateMap`/single-dataset approach in `frontend/src/components/players/ApaAggregateCharts.tsx` and instead building five fully independent per-series datasets (`ppiSeries`, `appiSeries`, `yourPointsSeries`, `opponentPointsSeries`, `defensiveShotsSeries`). Each series must include only entries that have (1) a valid x-axis date derived from the datapoint timestamp and (2) a valid numeric value for that specific series. Render each series as its own `<Line>` such that missing/invalid values for one metric never suppress the other lines. Preserve the existing chart sections and English legend labels: PPI, aPPI, Your Points, Opponent Points, Defensive Shots.",
