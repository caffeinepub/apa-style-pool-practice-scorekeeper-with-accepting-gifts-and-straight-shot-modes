  "summary": "REQ-122 is primarily about re-running deployment and verifying the live app/navigation. The diff shows multiple code changes (new SmokeCheckPage, router error fallback, match history UI tweaks, backend access/approval logic), but there is no evidence in the diff summary of any deployment trigger/run, deployment success verification, or live reachability checks being performed. Several new UI/behavior changes appear unrelated to simply re-running/verifying deployment.",

It does not show any CI/CD workflow trigger, deployment pipeline configuration/run output, or any verification artifacts (e.g., workflow files, deployment logs, health checks).
