  "summary": "All six requirements from the BuildRequest have been implemented in the diff. The changes correctly remove the checkbox UI (REQ-1), modify getFilteredMatches to return the full dataset without slicing (REQ-2), add the getMatchOutcomeAndPpi helper function (REQ-3), and update stat calculations to include both official and practice matches (REQ-4, REQ-5). However, REQ-6 (updating the Avg PPI display card structure) cannot be verified from the truncated diff, as the MatchupAnalysisPanel.tsx display code is cut off before reaching the UI rendering section.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Update the Avg PPI display card in MatchupAnalysisPanel to show the Last 10 Avg PPI as the primary value (large text) with two subtext lines below: 'Last 10' and 'Best 10 of last 20: [value]'",
      "reason": "The diff for MatchupAnalysisPanel.tsx is truncated before the UI rendering section. While the calculations for last10AvgPpi and best10Of20AvgPpi are visible in the logic, the actual Card/CardContent JSX that displays these values is not shown in the truncated diff.",
