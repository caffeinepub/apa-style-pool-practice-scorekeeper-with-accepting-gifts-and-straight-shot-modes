  "summary": "Diff implements some of the requested visual updates in ApaAggregateCharts.tsx (PPI line stroke/strokeWidth and connectNulls shown), but the diff is truncated before showing the remaining <Line /> components, so full compliance with REQ-250/REQ-251 cannot be verified. The change set also violates the BuildRequest constraint to modify only ApaAggregateCharts.tsx and introduces unrequested dot-shape customization.",

      "requirement": "Match Results chart lines must use exact strokes: Your Points #000, Opponent Points #2563eb, Defensive Shots #7c3aed; all with strokeWidth={2}.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet only shows the PPI & aPPI Trend portion and is truncated before the Match Results chart <Line /> definitions, so these required stroke/strokeWidth settings are not evidenced.",

      "requirement": "Set connectNulls={true} on every Recharts <Line /> used in both charts (all five lines).",
      "reason": "Only the PPI line explicitly shows connectNulls={true} in the provided snippet; the remaining lines are not visible due to truncation, so inclusion on all five lines is not evidenced.",
