However, the core requirement to fix score update logic in ApaRackScoringPanel.tsx itself is not evidenced in the diff. The actual component that handles ball selection and scoring (ApaRackScoringPanel.tsx) was not modified according to the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states to modify ApaRackScoringPanel.tsx or its direct dependencies, but ApaRackScoringPanel.tsx does not appear in the modified files list. The diff only shows changes to PracticeGamePage.tsx (parent component), urlParams.ts (utility), and frontend-file-summaries.txt/project_state.json (metadata). Without changes to ApaRackScoringPanel.tsx itself, the core score update logic when balls are clicked cannot be fixed at the source.",
