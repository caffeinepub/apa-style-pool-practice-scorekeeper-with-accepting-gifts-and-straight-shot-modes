Each series must include only entries that have (1) a valid x-axis date derived from the datapoint timestamp and (2) a valid numeric value for that specific series. Render each series as its own `<Line>` such that missing/invalid values for one metric never suppress the other lines. Preserve the existing chart sections and English legend labels: PPI, aPPI, Your Points, Opponent Points, Defensive Shots.",
