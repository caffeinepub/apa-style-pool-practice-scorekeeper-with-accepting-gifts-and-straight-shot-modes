# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the legend label "Candle (day)" to "Shots (day)" in the Straight Shot Trend Graph.

**Planned changes:**
- In `StraightShotTrendChart.tsx`, update the candlestick series legend label from `'Candle (day)'` to `'Shots (day)'`

**User-visible outcome:** The Straight Shot Trend Graph legend displays "Shots (day)" instead of "Candle (day)" while the "Trend" legend entry remains unchanged.
